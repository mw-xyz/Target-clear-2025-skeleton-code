# My notes for AQA CS paper 1 skeleton code (2025)

all (useful) zigzag stuff for target clear, skelly code itself and my solutions for each task which i can explain

would recommend doing a hierarchy chart from scratch yourself - ill also append my notes on each function in code-with-docstrings later

in each solution, type ctrl + F "#" to find each of my changes -- they are labelled with comments

ive also included the question where appropriate
